Welcome to my personal website!

As a young professional, I’m inspired by how data can solve real-world problems and improve the way people and organizations work. My experiences in analytics, organizational effectiveness, and process improvement have strengthened my belief in data’s power to create meaningful impact.

I’m especially drawn to the intersection of business, technology, and data science, where challenges become opportunities for smarter decisions and better outcomes. This portfolio reflects my learning journey and growth in data science.
